1. SignalPath has bought a new vending machine and it is going to be under heavy usage (we love snacks).  You have been nominated to test it and make sure it is up to the task.  How would you approach this?
Test Scenario:
To ensure the machine is properly loaded and ready to dispense
Test Cases:
Select one or several products by use both coin and paper money to pay for the item
It has to calculate the balance and allow the consumer to make a choice of product
Upon choosing the selected product has to highlight and machine has to dispense the correct product
The machine then deducts from balance the amount of purchase 
Or If the Credit/Debit card option there, it should accept the both cash and card
1. Create four test cases for Twitter's authentication func
tionality.
Test Scenario:
Login with correct user name and password
Test cases:
Login to the account using correct password and User name/ Email or Mobile number
Try to login from different system to account and check is it asking for any additional security questions to proceed
Test the negitive scenario by entring the wrong password or username
Upon entering the wrong password or user name it has to give options for recovery of account through Email or Mobile by sending the verification or security code
1. Suppose you have a web site with two form elements on it: a multi-line textarea and button that says "multiply". The expected behavior is that when you click "multiply" all of the numbers written in the textarea are multiplied together and written next to the textarea. For instance, if the textarea has the numbers 5, 7, 11 then the output will be 385. Identify all the test cases that you would need to write. (You do not actually need to write the detailed steps for every test case, just the summary.)
Test Scenario: 
Tesx area and its functions
Test Cases:
Check whether it is taking the correct the correct Delimiter ,,  ;, /, | or || 
Check whether the delimiter is correctly distuinguishing between the first and last strings used in test area
Check the text area is working or accepting the simple and Decimal values (2.5, 3.25 etc)
Check the text area for working with negitive values and value zero
Check the text area for otherthan Delimiter, working for Special characters (@, &, $...)
